# CollidingBalls
This program displays moving balls that will collide with each other in a new window.

To see this execute the play.py file.
When executing play.py the result is not being computed in real time. 
It is playing back the recording contained in the file recBall1.txt. 
The moves being computed in advance allows us to perform much more involved computation.

To create your own recording file execute collidingBalls_precomp.py. It will then overwrite recBall1.txt.
